An insane toolkit to manage my bloody well everything. In a database.

In theory, it's a Django application. In practice, I don't really care. Discord
will access it via an autogenerated peewee interface. Via a bot.

Install
-------

Scream. Aim. Fire. Take two of these. Call me in the morning.

`pip3 install pipenv`

`python3 pipenv install`

If you want to run tests and whathave you, you have to

`python3 pipenv install --dev`

That's essentially it.

But... but...
-------------

No. And have a test commit.
